Calorie-counter using gemini-vision-pro API. 

The core idea is to leverage the `gemini-pro-vision` api capabilities for tracking daily calorie in-take. Me & my partner recently started a fitness training program where we need to take photos and document calories consumed for every meal. We have started using the `gemini-pro-vision` API for tracking our consumption. While not perfect, it gets does a great job most of times and we are left with minimal edits to do. 

I plan to develop this into an app that can integrate with google `fit` app which is where we track our movement. I think this would be game-changer for us as currently we have to do much of this manually.
